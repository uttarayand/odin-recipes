                <li>Cooked meat or seafood (whatever you have left-over)</li>
                <li>Lightly blanched vegetables - topping</li>

            </ul>
        </p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Cook your rice the night before. Put the rice in a pan with 400ml boiling water. Stir once, bring to a simmer, then cover and turn the heat right down. Cook for 15 minutes, then take off the heat and leave on a damp tea towel or cloth for five minutes with the lid off. Fork through to fluff up, then spread on a baking tray and refrigerate, overnight if possible.</li>
                <li>Put the shallots, one tbsp neutral oil, 1 of the garlic cloves, the shrimp paste and the red chilli into a small blender or mortar and whizz or pound until fairly smooth.</li>
                <li>Heat 2 tbsp oil in a wok over a high heat, then fry the garlic until golden, not brown, then pour in the eggs, leave to cook until half set, then break up. Carry on frying the egg until it is just beginning to brown, then tip in the spice paste from the blender and cook for a minute or so.</li>
                <li>Add the rice by hand, breaking up any clumps as you go, and fry until heated through, then stir in the kecap manis, soy sauce, spring onion and chilli.</li>
                <li>Fry, stirring, for another minute or so, then taste and season as necessary - add your meat or seafood to reheat. Divide between plates and top with the lightly blanched vegetables and fried egg. Eat immediately.</li>
            </ol>
