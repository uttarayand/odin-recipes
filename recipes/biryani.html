    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Toss the lamb in a bowl with the garlic, ginger and a large pinch of salt. Marinate in the fridge overnight or for at least a couple of hours.</li>
                <li>Heat the oil in a casserole. Fry the lamb for 5-10 mins until starting to brown. Add the onion, cumin seeds and nigella seeds, and cook for 5 mins until starting to soften.</li>
                <li>Stir in the curry paste, then cook for 1 min more. Scatter in the rice and curry leaves, then pour over the stock and bring to the boil. Meanwhile, heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4.</li>
                <li>Stir in the paneer, spinach and some seasoning. Cover the dish with a tight lid of foil, then put the lid on to ensure it is well sealed. Cook in the oven for 20 mins, then leave to stand, covered, for 10 mins.</li>
                <li>Bring the dish to the table, remove the lid and foil, scatter with the chillies and serve with yogurt/raita on the side.</li>
